Type Annotations and Type Interence:

*  Type annotation:  Code we add to tell typescript what type of value a variable will refer to.
*  Type inference:  Typescript will trie to figure out what type of value a variable referes to.  

Type inference:  
  *  Variable Declaration:  const color 
  *  Variable Initialization:  "Red"
  *  If declartion and initialization are on the same line, Typescript will figure out the type of color is a string.  After that it will only accept strings.
