 Notes on typescript

*  Types:
    *  Type: Easy way to refer to the different properties + functions that a value has.
    *  Primitive Types:
        *  number
        *  Boolean
        *  void
        *  undefined
        *  string
        *  symbol
        *  null
    *  Object Types:
        *  functions
        *  arrays
        *  classes
        *  objects
    *  Why types:
        *  Are used by the Typescript compiler to detect and analyze code for errors         
        *  Allows other to understand what values are in the codebase and what they do.
