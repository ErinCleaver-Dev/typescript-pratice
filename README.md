S3 - Functions and Objects:
*  Annotations for functions:  Code we add to tell typescript what type of arguments a function will receive and what type of values it will return.
*  Inference for functions:  Type script types to figure out what type of value a function will return.  
*  No type inference for arguments
    *  With fucntions you always have to tell it the type for the intup variables in typescript. 
*  You should always include a annotation for the return value, to make sure you returned a value.
